How did I do these changes?

Easy! After setting up my SSH, I clicked on the README.md file on the right bottom side of RStudio Workbench. This window popped up. Now I'm making changes. Github's page was also useful to make emphasis on this report. Neat! 

Well setting up this github was pretty hard. The instructions on the website are a little confusing for people who use workbench. I've always cloned the https but I needed to do SSH link. That was one problem I've encountered.
